The plugin must be configured with options which all may be expressed in @grails-app/conf/Config.groovy@. A basic configuration might look something like this:

{code}
// grails-app/conf/Config.groovy
openerp {
    baseurl = 'http://localhost:8069/xmlrpc'
    db = 'testdb'
    usr = 'testuser'
    pwd = 'testpwd'
}
{code}

Those are settings which are necessary in order for the plugin to be able to connect to and communicate with a OpenERP instance.
